## Introduction

Cryptography is a vital aspect of digital security and privacy, and understanding its practical implementation is essential for any aspiring computer scientist. This repository is tailored for students of the CSIT 5th Semester (IOST, TU) and focuses exclusively on cryptography code practicals. Here, you will find various cryptographic algorithms implemented through code, enabling you to experiment, learn, and apply these techniques in real-world scenarios.

---

## Repository Overview

This repository contains:

- **Practical Code Samples**: Implementations of cryptographic algorithms in multiple programming languages.
- **Hands-On Exercises**: Ready-to-run labs and exercises to help you understand and experiment with cryptographic concepts.
- **Clear Documentation**: Each code practical comes with comments and instructions to guide you through the logic and usage of the algorithms.

Our main goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, providing a robust learning tool for cryptography.
